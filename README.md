This is the code for all the projects I have worked on.

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE CODE**

**Project #1 - Algorithmic Trading Bot**
- To see the high-low point detection algorithm, run the file titled "TurningPoints.py". The stock ticker can be inputted into line 269, while the start date, end date, and R value can be inputted into line 271
- To see the trendline-generation algorithm, run the file titled "Trendlines.py". The stock ticker can be inputted into line 555, while the start and end dates can be inputted into line 556 and 557 respectively.
- Please do not tinker with the other files

**Project #2 - TicTacToe**
